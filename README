To use relative path names below an every-changing working directory, set "CHOMP_ROOT_FOLDER" enviromental variable to the directory you want to start from.
Very useful during SSHFS mounting of external drives. The classes will detect the enviroment on-load, so you always have the correct data path no matter if you work
directly on the remote server, or on the local computer.

Examine the chomp_options class to see all the parameters you might want to play with

Most important parameters:
 - Directory structure is defined by input_folder, output_folder, precomputed_folder and results_folder, the software will extensively use these (make sure there is proper read/write access at all times)
 - data_path: path to one of your original tiff images / matlab stack / json directory
 - src_string: inclusion criterion within file names (for most people something like *Ch2* or *.tif will work)
 - file_prefix: You can define this custom file name portion for all files written by CHOMP. Note that all runs will be uniquely identified by time-stamping anyway.
 
 - m: Basis function width, all cells should be smaller than this
 - spatial_scale: resize your whole dataset spatially (such that cells are within m)
 - time_scale: Downsample your data temporally (such that within-cell signal propagation is generally avoided)
 
 - NSS: number of object types
 - KS: dimensionality of subspace to describe an object type (# of basis functions / object type)

 - niter: # of iterations (set it to 1 for inference)

 - W_init: initial basis functions (can be empty in general, as they are learned iteratively)
