To use relative path names below an every-changing wokring directory, set "CHOMP_ROOT_FOLDER" enviromental variable to the directory you want to start from.
Very useful during SSHFS mounting of external drives. The classes will detect the enviroment on-load, so you always have the correct data path no matter if you work
directly on the remote server, or on the local computer.

TODO:
- random proj: 
	easy but inefficient version: just implement a random proj tensor, that maps from z*z patches to d*d size of basis functions and just multiply W with the tensor before convolution: doesn’t make sense cause we’re still doing the z*z size convolution:
	better version is to do the random proj, compute the cumulant estimates already in random proj space, and just store those estimate at every location.
	Because we dont have to store stuff in memory anymore, this would work well.
